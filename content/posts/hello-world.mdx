This is the first post on my new blog. I built it with Next.js 15, MDX, and Tailwind CSS.

## Why another blog?

I wanted a space to share long-form thoughts, quick learnings, and interesting links I find around the web.

## The stack

- **Next.js 15** with the App Router
- **MDX** for content with React components
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Vercel** for deployment

More posts coming soon.
